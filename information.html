            <h1>Seychelles</h1>

            <p>Isabella Tree describes Seychelles as a "mythical paradise," saying, "I've never seen so many extraordinary beaches and so few people on them. The forests are lush, the beaches are loaded with green and hawksbill turtles, and the water is crowded with fish." A native of England, Tree travels often and has written a new book, Sliced Iguana – Travels in Unknown Mexico, an engaging collection of stories about her journeys through hidden corners of Mexico (including Janitzio Island, which she covered on an ISLANDS assignment). The book has just been released by Hamish Hamilton (Penguin Books).

            Florida-based photographer Darrell Jones, who has been traveling for more than 30 years and has visited all seven continents, says Seychelles is truly the most beautiful place in the world. "It's remarkable; I absolutely have to go back," he says. His favorite moment? When he saw a small shark chasing a bonefish in a breaking wave on Alphonse. That's fitting for a man who got his start as a surf photographer. Jones has been shooting for ISLANDS for 17 years.
    
            On The Nature Trail For hiking, Jones recommends Silhouette Island. ("It's rugged with no roads but plenty of trails through thick vegetation.") For spectacular fly-fishing, he suggests walking the bonefish flats near Alphonse. ("You can catch 50 fish a day there.") The highlight of Praslin is the coco-de- mer at Vallée de Mai. And Bird Island was "teeming with birds," says Tree, "including hundreds of thousands of noisy sooty terns."
    
            Beach Time These are some of the best beaches in the world; you can fine-tune your preferences and get more spoiled as you go. Anse Victorin on Frigate was the most beautiful beach Jones had ever seen. ("It's small and intimate, with white sand, palm trees, turquoise water, and rocky headlands on each side," he says.) Tree's favorite was on Bird Island. ("The entire circumference of the island is an otherworldly beach. It's the most solitary and contemplative.")
